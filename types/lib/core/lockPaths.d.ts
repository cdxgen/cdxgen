/**
 * Containment check for a path taken from a lockfile (issue #3816). A crafted
 * npm lockfile can name `file:`/`link:` specifiers or link targets built from
 * `..` chains or absolute paths, so a parser that is about to list such an
 * entry checks the resolved path against the project root first.
 *
 * The candidate is resolved against `projectRoot`, so both relative values
 * and the absolute paths arborist already normalised are accepted. The root
 * itself counts as inside: a lockfile may legitimately link the project to
 * its own directory.
 *
 * @param {string} candidate Path to check, absolute or relative to projectRoot
 * @param {string} projectRoot Project root the path must stay inside; a falsy
 *   root means the current working directory, mirroring `node:path`
 *
 * @returns {Boolean} True when the path is inside projectRoot
